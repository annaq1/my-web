            <p>Raised in the shadow of Noxian occupation, Irelia developed one of the most exotic—and deadly—fighting styles in Ionia. While most of her family died at the hands of the invaders, she survived and learned to wield her levitating blades with nothing but her own determined spirit. She remains a fierce symbol of the resistance, ready to strike down any tyrant who may reach the shores of her homeland.</p>
